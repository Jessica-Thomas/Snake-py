# To execute:

You must have Python and pip installed.

Clone the repo and from the terminal/shell/bash run the following command:

pip install -r requirements.txt

From there, you can run snake.py from your shell.





There are sounds and music commented out. They do work as long as you make the code active again-- I turned them off because the sounds were excessive.
